# VAD Integration Test Plan

## Frontend VAD Implementation ✅

### Enhanced AudioVisualizer Features:
1. **Advanced VAD Logic**: 
   - Multi-threshold detection (noise floor: 8, voice: 25, strong voice: 40)
   - Speech/silence counters to prevent false positives
   - Debouncing logic to avoid rapid on/off switching

2. **Audio Streaming**:
   - Real-time audio capture with 16-bit PCM conversion
   - Automatic chunking every ~200ms during voice activity
   - Base64 encoding for WebSocket transmission
   - Proper start/stop detection with silence thresholds

3. **WebSocket Integration**:
   - Global WebSocket reference for AudioVisualizer access
   - Automatic audio playback for TTS responses
   - Comprehensive message type handling

### Backend VAD Integration ✅
- WebRTC VAD (mode 2) for server-side validation
- Early filtering of silent chunks to improve performance
- Streaming STT processing with is_final flags

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Voice Activity Detection
- [ ] Speak normally - should detect voice after ~60ms
- [ ] Whisper quietly - should still detect with enhanced sensitivity  
- [ ] Background noise (fan, typing) - should NOT trigger recording
- [ ] Short silence pauses - should continue recording
- [ ] Long silence (>160ms) - should stop recording and send final chunk

### 2. Audio Streaming
- [ ] Check browser console for "🎙️ Starting voice recording..."
- [ ] Verify audio chunks being sent: "🎵 Sending audio chunk: X bytes, final: false"
- [ ] Final chunk should show "final: true"
- [ ] Backend should process and respond with transcription

### 3. Audio Output
- [ ] AI responses should play automatically through browser audio
- [ ] Audio should be clear and at proper volume
- [ ] Multiple responses should queue properly

### 4. Error Handling
- [ ] Microphone permission denied - proper UI feedback
- [ ] WebSocket disconnection - reconnection attempts
- [ ] Network errors - graceful degradation

## Known Issues Fixed

1. **Frontend VAD was too sensitive** ✅
   - Old: Simple threshold of 15 triggered on any noise
   - New: Multi-threshold system with debouncing

2. **No audio streaming** ✅  
   - Old: Only visual analysis, no backend communication
   - New: Real-time audio capture and WebSocket streaming

3. **No voice output** ✅
   - Old: No audio playback implementation  
   - New: Automatic TTS audio playback via Web Audio API

4. **Backend VAD unused** ✅
   - Old: Frontend never sent audio data
   - New: Frontend streams audio, backend applies WebRTC VAD

## Expected Improvements

- **Reduced false positives**: No more triggering on keyboard typing, fans, etc.
- **Better voice detection**: Proper human voice frequency analysis
- **Real-time conversation**: Audio in → transcription → LLM → TTS → audio out
- **Sub-second latency**: Optimized streaming pipeline
