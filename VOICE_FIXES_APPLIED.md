# Voice Agent Reliability Fixes Applied

Based on your comprehensive checklist, I've implemented all the key fixes to make your voice agent reliably pick up human speech while ignoring room noise and dead-air packets.

## âœ… 1. Frontend VAD Threshold Calibration

**Problem**: Thresholds were way too high (25/40), causing "No speech detected"
**Fix Applied**: Used your measured RMS values to set proper thresholds:

```typescript
// Calibrated based on measured RMS values
// Background RMS: ~300, Speech RMS: ~1406
const noiseFloor = 400;          // ~300 * 1.3
const voiceThreshold = 1000;     // ~1406 * 0.7  
const strongVoiceThreshold = 1700; // ~1406 * 1.2
```

## âœ… 2. Audio Processing Improvements

**Problem**: Frontend was too permissive, backend too impatient
**Fixes Applied**:
- Disabled `autoGainControl` in getUserMedia (set to `false`)
- Added high-pass filter at 120Hz to kill HVAC rumble
- Set gain boost to 2.0x (tunable 1.5-3.0x range)
- Focused VAD on human voice frequencies (300Hz - 3400Hz)

## âœ… 3. Backend Buffer Discipline

**Problem**: Deepgram getting chunks too short, Whisper VAD too aggressive
**Fixes Applied**:
- Added server-side noise gate: skip chunks with RMS < 0.01 and peak < 0.05
- Added minimum speech buffer requirement: 700ms (22,400 bytes at 16kHz)
- Disabled Whisper's `vad_filter` (set to `false`) - rely on WebRTC/RNNoise instead

```python
# Apply minimum speech buffer requirement (700ms at 16kHz)
min_speech_bytes = 16000 * 0.7 * 2  # 0.7s * 16kHz * 2 bytes per sample
if len(websocket._audio_buffer) < min_speech_bytes:
    logger.debug("Audio buffer too short - waiting for more")
    return
```

## âœ… 4. WebSocket Connection Stability

**Problem**: Connection health issues, missing heartbeat_ack type
**Fixes Applied**:
- Added `heartbeat_ack` to WebSocketMessage type union
- Added connection state check before sending heartbeat responses
- Improved connection health monitoring with proper pong tracking

## âœ… 5. Streaming & Buffer Discipline

**Problem**: Chunks too large, connection instability
**Fixes Applied**:
- Keep WebSocket frames â‰¤ 100KB (~3s at 16kHz)
- Added proper connection state checking before sending
- Improved heartbeat interval to 30s (less aggressive)

## âœ… 6. Updated Configuration

**Updated `voice_config.json`** with calibrated settings:
```json
{
  "vad_settings": {
    "noise_floor": 400,
    "voice_threshold": 1000, 
    "strong_voice_threshold": 1700,
    "webrtc_vad_mode": 2
  },
  "audio_processing": {
    "min_speech_buffer_ms": 700,
    "max_frame_bytes": 100000,
    "auto_gain_control": false
  }
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

With these fixes, you should see:

1. **No more "No speech detected"** - thresholds now properly calibrated
2. **No more Welsh ("cy") transcripts** - noise gate prevents pure noise chunks
3. **Faster response times** - 700ms buffer vs previous longer delays
4. **Better connection stability** - improved heartbeat and state management
5. **Cleaner audio** - high-pass filter removes HVAC hum

## ðŸ§ª Quick Sanity Test

As recommended in your checklist:

1. **Silent test**: RMS should stay < 400 (noiseFloor) when not speaking
2. **Speech test**: RMS should cross 1000 (voiceThreshold) within 400ms of speaking
3. **Backend test**: Deepgram partials should appear in â‰¤ 300ms

## ðŸ“Š Key Threshold Summary

| Layer | Setting | Value | Purpose |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| Frontend | noiseFloor | 400 | Background noise baseline |
| Frontend | voiceThreshold | 1000 | Speech detection trigger |
| Frontend | strongVoiceThreshold | 1700 | Strong speech confirmation |
| Backend | min_speech_buffer_ms | 700 | Minimum audio before STT |
| Backend | noise_gate_rms | 0.01 | Server-side silence filter |
| Backend | noise_gate_peak | 0.05 | Server-side silence filter |

All fixes are now applied and ready for testing! ðŸš€
